        <h5>Academy to increase knowledge and skills</h5>
        <p>Achieving a satisfactory level in writing in English is the primary concern of both teachers and learners. However, the majority of students are unable to reach this satisfaction for the writing skill entails a series of difficulties that result in students’ poor writing productions. They find it very difficult to master and; therefore, fail to produce acceptable texts: paragraphs and essays. This study deals with the learners' poor achievements in writing</p>
        <p>Thus, the overall purpose is, at the first place, to determine some factors that markedly restrict the learners' ability to write correctly and then translate the research findings into advice and guidance. Second, to make all the teachers (either written expression or other modules) aware about the writing deficiencies in order to improve the ways of teaching writing</p>

              <div class="line"></div>
              <p>This study investigates the effectiveness of teaching writing through a reading/writing workshop approach to develop students’ writing abilities and skills. It is worth mentioning that for practical reasons, the researcher made an adjustement in the choice of the population under study. Thus, the participants are second year LMD students at the department of English, Faculty of Letters and Languages, University of Bejaia. To carry out the research, a quasi experimental design is adopted. For this purpose, two groups displaying similar performance in the writing proficiency pre-test were randomly assigned into an experimental group and a control groups. The experimental group (n=16) was taught writing through a reading/writing workshop approach while the control group (n=16) received no manipulation. The treatment phase took place during the first semester of the academic year: 2013-2014 and lasted 16 weeks</p>
